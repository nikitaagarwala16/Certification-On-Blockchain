# Certification-On-Blockchain
>This smart contract enables us make an effective anti-forge mechanism,so that one can tackle fake certificates. In order to solve the problem of counterfeiting certificates, the digital certificate system based on blockchain technology is implemented. By the unmodifiable property of blockchain, the digital certificate with anti-counterfeit and verifiability could be made. 

##Components of the Smart Contract

Some of the components are :-

| Component| Descriptions |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| struct Certificate | Stores information such as certificate's  unique ID number,candidate's name, course name and the organisation. |
| converttobytes() | Converts any given string into 32 bytes |
| storeCertificate() | Verifies all the input details and stores these details in blockchain under certificate structure. |
| verifyCertificate() | Checks if the certificate with the given ID is present in blockchain or not. |
